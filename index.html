            <p id="page2paragraph">We believe independent restaurants occupy a distinctive position in the world of business. They are visible, important and integral parts of the communities they serve. Unlike their chain counterparts, people often have a personal connection to one or more of their home grown restaurants. Independents have a local identity and are often one of the most tangible representations of an area's heritage, history and unique character.

                <p class="paragraph"> Burgers contain several vitamins which are mostly from the family of B vitamins.
                    Generally, these vitamins help in using the energy of the food in a proper way. B vitamins also help
                    your body in creating red blood cells.</p>

                <p class="paragraph"> The other amazing thing about pizza is that it's delicious no matter what time of
                    day
                    you eat it. You can eat pizza for lunch, dinner, as a midnight meal, as a hungover breakfast, or
                    even as
                    a giant snack when you're really feeling hungry.</p>
